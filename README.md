# Fashion-MNIST-in-Wolfram

University project with goal to try and play around Mathematica's API. 

In this file I've checked different architectures of Neural Networks to solve Fashion MNIST, and played with functionalities of set augmentation.

After initial experimentation with reusing currently compiled Neural Nets from Wolfram's repository, I've tackled the problem of setting up something, that would get over 97% acuraccy.

Later I've tested some adversarial examples to see how my architecture is attack proof, from noise generated attacks(I've had problems with accessing gradient tapes, to code down my own lstm generator).
